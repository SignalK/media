<h1>The Free and Open Source universal Marine Data Exchange</h1>
<h2>Use Rubik only for headings and only in bold (700) and black (800) font weight.</h2>

<p>The text and captions use <strong>Jura font</strong>. Feel free to use all weights. Signal K is a modern and open data format for marine use. Built on standard web technologies including JSON, WebSockets and HTTP, Signal K provides a method for sharing information independent of the underlying communications protocol (e.g. NMEA0183, NMEA2000, SeaTalk, I2C, 1-Wire, ZigBee, etc) in a way that is friendly to WiFi, cellphones, tablets, and the Internet. A format available to everyone, where anyone can contribute, Signal K is the first truly open data format for the marine industry and is set to revolutionize how we consume and interact with data on boats.</p>
